Graduating from the University of Bristol with a MSc in Advanced Computing, I currently working as a Software Developer at one of the UK biggest e-commerce group. I enjoy working with JavaScript both front-end and back-end. I’d like to adapt latest technologies, tools and frameworks such as React, Redux, ES.Next and WebPack to build the prefect web. With my strong academic background and years of experience, I am no doubt that you will be benefit hugely from having me as part of your up coming projects.

I truly love coding and refactoring. I can spend days to refactoring my code over and over again until it reaches its perfect state. Honestly, that inspire me going to work everyday – to perfect things.
